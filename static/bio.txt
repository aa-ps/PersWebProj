I'm a Junior studying Computer Science. I enjoy learning and experimenting with new ideas. At the same time, I like starting new projects in which I learn more from. Currently, I have taught myself Angular, HTML, CSS, C++, C, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, and on progress towards learning NodeJS, ReactJS, and MySQL. I am also interested in Cybersecurity, and familiar with Web Application attacks.
